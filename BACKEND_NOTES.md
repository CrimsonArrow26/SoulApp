# Backend Integration Notes - COMPLETED

This document summarizes the changes made to the frontend and outlines the complete backend integration with Supabase Edge Functions for a server-side-only approach.

## Frontend Changes Completed:

1. **Profile Completion (`app/profile-setup.tsx`)**:
   - **Date of Birth**: Replaced manual text input with a native `DateTimePicker` component.
   - **Gender**: Added a multi-option selector (Male/Female/Other).
   - **Photo Uploads**: All 4 photo slots are now mandatory for form submission. The built-in image editor (cropping) is enabled. Photo tiles maintain a fixed aspect ratio, and tapping a filled tile opens a fullscreen viewer.
   - **Continue Button**: Made sticky at the bottom, with a transparent background. It's disabled until all required fields (full name, nickname, DOB, gender, 4 photos) are complete.
   - **Full Name**: Changed the label from "First Name" to "Full Name".

2. **App Branding**:
   - App name changed from "Soul Store" to "Soul Signal" in `app.json` and `app/introduction.tsx`.

3. **Interests Setup (`app/interests-setup.tsx`)**:
   - **Multi-select Cards**: Cards 2 ("Passions & Interests") and 4 ("Stories & Memories") were converted to multi-option chip selectors.
   - **Prompts**: Updated prompts for these cards to be suitable for multi-selection.
   - **Emojis**: Removed emojis from card titles and mini-card indicators.
   - **Background Art**: Added subtle `ArtworkBackground` elements to each interest card.

4. **Insights Section (`app/(tabs)/insights.tsx`)**:
   - **UI Enhancement**: Restyled the Insights screen to look more appealing, including a KPI row, overall score ring accent, and harmonized typography.

5. **Supabase Setup (Client-side)**:
   - Added `@react-native-community/datetimepicker` dependency to `package.json`.
   - Created `types/modules.d.ts` for TypeScript declarations.

## Backend Integration - COMPLETED âœ…

The goal was to move all data operations to Supabase Edge Functions, making the client app purely a UI layer that communicates via `fetch` to these endpoints.

### Completed Edge Functions:

1. **`supabase/functions/_shared/supabaseClient.ts`**:
   - **Purpose**: Provides a shared utility to create a Supabase client instance within Edge Functions.
   - **Key Detail**: Uses `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` from Deno environment variables, ensuring the service role key is never exposed client-side.
   - **Status**: âœ… **Completed**

2. **`supabase/functions/profile-get/index.ts`**:
   - **Purpose**: An HTTP GET endpoint to fetch the authenticated user's profile.
   - **Key Detail**: Authenticates the request using `supabase.auth.getUser()` and then queries the `profiles` table for the corresponding `user.id`.
   - **Status**: âœ… **Completed**

3. **`supabase/functions/profile-upsert/index.ts`**:
   - **Purpose**: An HTTP POST endpoint to create or update a user's profile.
   - **Key Detail**: Authenticates the request, validates incoming JSON data (e.g., required fields, photo count), and performs an `upsert` operation on the `profiles` table.
   - **Status**: âœ… **Completed**

4. **`supabase/functions/chat-create/index.ts`**:
   - **Purpose**: An HTTP POST endpoint to create new chats (both mystery and normal mode).
   - **Key Detail**: For normal mode, requires `otherUserId`. For mystery mode, randomly pairs with another mystery user. Prevents duplicate chats.
   - **Status**: âœ… **Completed**

5. **`supabase/functions/chat-list/index.ts`**:
   - **Purpose**: An HTTP GET endpoint to list user's chats with other member information.
   - **Key Detail**: Returns chats with other user's profile data (nickname, photos, mode) for display.
   - **Status**: âœ… **Completed**

6. **`supabase/functions/message-send/index.ts`**:
   - **Purpose**: An HTTP POST endpoint to send messages in a chat.
   - **Key Detail**: Validates chat membership, creates message record, and updates chat's `updated_at` timestamp.
   - **Status**: âœ… **Completed**

7. **`supabase/functions/message-list/index.ts`**:
   - **Purpose**: An HTTP GET endpoint to retrieve messages from a chat.
   - **Key Detail**: Supports pagination, validates chat membership, and marks messages as read for the requesting user.
   - **Status**: âœ… **Completed**

8. **`supabase/functions/insight-list/index.ts`**:
   - **Purpose**: An HTTP GET endpoint to list insights for user's chats.
   - **Key Detail**: Can filter by specific chat or return insights for all user's chats.
   - **Status**: âœ… **Completed**

9. **`supabase/functions/insight-generate/index.ts`**:
   - **Purpose**: An HTTP POST endpoint to generate AI insights for a chat.
   - **Key Detail**: Analyzes recent messages and creates insight records with engagement scores, compatibility metrics, and generated insights.
   - **Status**: âœ… **Completed**

### SQL Schema Provided:

- `profiles`: Stores user details (full_name, nickname, dob, gender, bio, photos, interests, mode).
- `chats`: Manages chat sessions.
- `chat_members`: Links users to chats.
- `messages`: Stores chat messages with sender, content, and timestamps.
- `matches`: Manages user match statuses.
- `insights`: Stores AI-generated conversation insights.
- **RLS**: Enabled for all tables with policies to ensure data privacy (e.g., users can only see/update their own profiles, chat members can only see their chat messages).

## What You Need To Do Next:

### 1. Deploy Edge Functions to Supabase:
```bash
# Install Supabase CLI if not already installed
npm install -g supabase

# Login to Supabase
supabase login

# Link your project
supabase link --project-ref bfgcnhdclzblilvdkutb

# Deploy all functions
supabase functions deploy
```

### 2. Set Environment Variables in Supabase:
In your Supabase dashboard, go to Settings > Edge Functions and set these secrets:
- `SUPABASE_URL`: `https://bfgcnhdclzblilvdkutb.supabase.co`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`: Your service role key

### 3. Run the SQL Schema:
Execute the provided SQL in your Supabase SQL editor to create all tables, indexes, and RLS policies.

### 4. Update Frontend Stores:
Modify `hooks/auth-store.ts` and `hooks/chat-store.ts` to use `fetch` calls to the new Edge Function endpoints instead of local state/AsyncStorage.

### 5. Implement Authentication:
Set up Supabase Auth in your app (email/password, OAuth, etc.) and ensure the JWT token is passed in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header to all Edge Function calls.

## API Endpoints Available:

- `GET /profile-get` - Get user profile
- `POST /profile-upsert` - Create/update user profile
- `POST /chat-create` - Create new chat
- `GET /chat-list` - List user's chats
- `POST /message-send` - Send message
- `GET /message-list?chat_id=<id>` - Get chat messages
- `GET /insight-list?chat_id=<id>` - Get insights
- `POST /insight-generate` - Generate new insights

All endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>` header.

## Next Steps for Frontend Integration:
1. Replace AsyncStorage with API calls in stores
2. Implement proper error handling
3. Add loading states
4. Implement real-time updates (optional)
5. Add photo upload to Supabase Storage (optional)

The backend is now complete and ready for frontend integration! ðŸš€
